# Calculator

1 Overview

In this project I implement two calculators in C++, mainly including the knowledge of class encapsulation, inheritance, derivation,
operator overload and the implementation of stack. I also use QT Creator to simulate the graphical interface of the calculator which
includes the buttons of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, parentheses, equal sign and 10 digital buttons as well 
a clear button to clear the contents on the display.
